   - Functions:
     - Function declaration, arrow functions, function expressions.
     - Function parameters, return values, and higher-order functions.

   - DOM Manipulation:
     - Selecting elements with `getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.
     - Adding, removing, or modifying elements with `innerHTML`, `appendChild`, `removeChild`.
     - Handling events (`click`, `submit`, `keydown`) and event listeners (`addEventListener`).

   - Arrays and Objects:
     - Array methods: `push()`, `pop()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`.
     - Object properties and methods, destructuring assignment.

   - Promises & Async Programming:
     - Understanding asynchronous operations.
     - Promises, `.then()`, `.catch()`, `finally`.
     - `async/await` syntax for handling asynchronous code.

   - JavaScript ES6+ Features:
     - Template literals, `const` and `let`, arrow functions, default parameters.
     - Destructuring, spread/rest operators (`...`), object shorthand, and dynamic imports.

   - Fetch API & AJAX:
     - Making HTTP requests using the Fetch API, and handling JSON data.

   - Modules:
     - Importing and exporting modules in ES6+.

 4. Preprocessors
CSS Preprocessors extend CSS capabilities by adding features like variables, mixins, nesting, and loops, making your stylesheets more maintainable and organized.

 SASS/SCSS:
   - Variables: 
     Define reusable values for colors, fonts, spacing, etc. (`$primary-color: 333;`).

   - Nesting: 
     Use nesting to reflect the hierarchy of your HTML elements.

   - Mixins: 
     Create reusable chunks of CSS code.

   - Inheritance/Extending: 
     Use the `@extend` directive to inherit styles from other classes.

   - Functions & Loops: 
     Use control directives like `@for`, `@each`, `@if` to create dynamic styles.

 5. Frameworks & Libraries
Frontend frameworks and libraries speed up development and help create complex web applications by offering ready-to-use components and structure.

 CSS Frameworks:
   - Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/):
     - A popular responsive framework that provides pre-designed components like navigation bars, buttons, forms, grids, and more.

   - Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation):
     - A utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs quickly by composing CSS classes directly in your HTML.

 JavaScript Frameworks & Libraries:
   - React.js:
